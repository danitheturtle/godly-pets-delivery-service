A game about delivering very particular lil guys to eldrich gods by climbing the puzzle staircase in each of their realms.

Godly Pets Delivery Service is a puzzle game where you rotate platforms and staircases to climb to the throne of eldrich gods. Your job is to deliver them custom ordered, very particular lil guys. The cutest weird creatures from all over the multiverse.

Each "world" (set of levels) takes place in a different realm with a different pet needing delivery to a different god. Each set of levels has a unique twist on the stairs mechanic, building on previous levels, and catering to the specific movement style of the beast you guide.
